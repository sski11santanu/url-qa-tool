This has led to mutual fund managers blaming the banking lobby for some of the rule changes in recent times. But the theory of stock market hurting banking deposit growth may be flawed, argue Nomura analysts Param Subramanian, Ankit Bihani, Ajit Kumar, and Parth Desai.\\n\\nFrom their note:\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement\\n\\nRemove Ad\\n\\n“There is a misplaced narrative among many investors that money moving into capital markets (stocks and mutual funds) is affecting system deposit growth. This is incorrect, as flows into capital markets stay with the banking system (money flows from the buyer’s deposit account to the seller). In fact, money in capital markets finds no mention in RBI’s broad money statistics – as this is already accounted for in system deposit data.”\\n\\nStill cautious\\n\\nStill cautious\\n\\nThe market is rallying, but foreign investors don’t seem to be giving in to the fear of missing out (FOMO) for now.\\n\\nFrom Emkay strategist Seshadri Sen’s note:\\n\\nFrom Emkay strategist Seshadri Sen’s note:\\n\\n“Long-only investors have largely missed the post-election rally, both on absolute allocations to India and sector positioning in high-beta SMIDs.

Meanwhile, Swiggy’s trading losses reduced to $158mn during FY24 while Zomato reported a positive Ebitda of $5mn during FY24.\\n\\nAccording to analysts at Emkay Global, Zomato’s higher growth has been aided by the superior performance of its Quick Commerce. Meanwhile, Swiggy\\'s revenue increased 24 percent on-year, while Zomato\\'s adjusted revenue rose by nearly 56 percent YoY.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nGainers & Losers: Stocks that moved the most on July 9\\n\\nKeystone Realtors share jump 6% as Q1 presales jump 22% on-year\\n\\nICICI Lombard rises 2%, nears 52-week high on strong June premium collection\\n\\nFollow our market blog to catch all the live action\\n\\nCLSA has issued a buy call on Zomato with a target price of Rs 248 per share. Another international brokerage UBS has also recommended a buy rating on the food aggregator\\'s stock with a target price of Rs 250.\\n\\nAccording to Emkay Global\\'s analysts, Swiggy’s performance reflects the continued traction of food delivery and rise of quick commerce.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement\\n\\nRemove Ad\\n\\n\"Steady improvement in operational performance and the planned IPO of Swiggy are likely to keep investor interest high in the space,\" the brokerage said as it maintained its \\'buy\\' call on Zomato with a target price of Rs 230 per share.\\n\\nRecently, Morgan Stanley retained its ‘overweight’ rating on Zomato with a target of Rs 235. The brokerage said Zepto raising funding round increases the relevance of Quick Commerce (QC) channel.\\n\\nLast week, Zepto announced that it has raised $665 million in a funding round that has doubled its valuations to $3.6 billion. This fundraise marked the biggest financing this year in the QC segment.\\n\\nAlso Read |\\xa0Morgan Stanley remains logged into internet stocks, prefers Zomato and PB Fintech\\n\\nMorgan Stanley said there is a probability that the competitive intensity may increase in the segment over the near term. It noted that assuming competitive intensity increases further, a push out of profitability for Quick commerce business versus the current assumptions is possible.\\n\\nAccording to analysts, any correction in Zomato could be a buying opportunity for the long-term investors.\\n\\nBernstein also has a \\'Buy\\' call on Zomato stock with a target price of Rs 230 per share. The brokerage cited the company\\'s market leadership, pricing power, and reduced delivery costs as key factors enabling it to achieve expanding margins and improved returns.\\n\\nAt 9:17 am, Zomato shares were trading 2.2 percent higher at Rs 203.04 on NSE. With today\\'s jump, the stock has delivered 63 percent returns on a year-to-date (YTD) basis\\n\\nIn the last one year, the stock has risen over 170 percent, massively outperforming benchmark Nifty 50 which rose 26 percent during this period.\\n\\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Meanwhile, Swiggy’s trading losses reduced to $158mn during FY24 while Zomato reported a positive Ebitda of $5mn during FY24.\\n\\nAccording to analysts at Emkay Global, Zomato’s higher growth has been aided by the superior performance of its Quick Commerce. Meanwhile, Swiggy\\'s revenue increased 24 percent on-year, while Zomato\\'s adjusted revenue rose by nearly 56 percent YoY.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nInvestec bullish on BSE but flags potentially severe regulatory risk; check target price\\n\\nNykaa sees 1.47 crore shares exchanged in block deals, shares sink\\n\\nMarathon Nextgen Realty sheds 7.5% after presale value nearly halves in Q1\\n\\nFollow our market blog to catch all the live action\\n\\nCLSA has issued a buy call on Zomato with a target price of Rs 248 per share.

The brokerage said Zepto raising funding round increases the relevance of Quick Commerce (QC) channel.\\n\\nLast week, Zepto announced that it has raised $665 million in a funding round that has doubled its valuations to $3.6 billion. This fundraise marked the biggest financing this year in the QC segment.\\n\\nAlso Read |\\xa0Morgan Stanley remains logged into internet stocks, prefers Zomato and PB Fintech\\n\\nMorgan Stanley said there is a probability that the competitive intensity may increase in the segment over the near term. It noted that assuming competitive intensity increases further, a push out of profitability for Quick commerce business versus the current assumptions is possible.\\n\\nAccording to analysts, any correction in Zomato could be a buying opportunity for the long-term investors.\\n\\nBernstein also has a \\'Buy\\' call on Zomato stock with a target price of Rs 230 per share. The brokerage cited the company\\'s market leadership, pricing power, and reduced delivery costs as key factors enabling it to achieve expanding margins and improved returns.\\n\\nAt 9:17 am, Zomato shares were trading 2.2 percent higher at Rs 203.04 on NSE.
